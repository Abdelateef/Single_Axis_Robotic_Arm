# Single_Axis_Robotic_Arm 

This repository contains the documentation and code for a project focused on the design and control of a single-axis robotic arm for precise and accurate motion. The project involves mathematical modeling, controller design, simulations, and analysis of the robotic arm's behavior.

## Project Overview

Robotic arms are crucial in various industrial and research applications, performing tasks that require high precision and accuracy. This project aims to design and control a single-axis robotic arm for such purposes. The primary objectives are:

- **System Modeling**: Develop a mathematical model of the robotic arm's dynamics, considering motor characteristics, mechanical components, and feedback systems.

- **Controller Design**: Design a control strategy, including PID control, to ensure precise and accurate motion of the robotic arm. The design aims to minimize overshoot, reduce settling time, and achieve the desired performance characteristics.

- **Simulations and Analysis**: Implement the control strategy using MATLAB/Simulink for simulation and analysis. Evaluate the robotic arm's behavior, response to different inputs, and assess the impact of the control design.
